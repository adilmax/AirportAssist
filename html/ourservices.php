                                        Airlines do not offer in- flight assistance with any medical services, assistance inside the lavatory, or in actual feeding for passengers with disability. Our safety assistant can take care of all those needs and more. The primary role of the personal safety assistant is to assist a disabled customer exiting the aircraft in case of an emergency evacuation or to establish communication for the required safety briefing, and assist with the medical, feeding and lavatory needs of a disabled customer.
